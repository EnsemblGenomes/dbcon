#summary How the XML format is structured and things to be aware of
#labels Phase-Implementation,Phase-Support,Featured

= Example Format =

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<sqllib>
  <sql name="nameInHere">
    select 1 from dual
  </sql>

  <sql name="anotherName">
  <![CDATA[
    select 'a' from dual
  ]]>
  </sql>
</sqllib>
}}}

= Why use CDATA =

XML defines a number of reserved keywords including:
  * '
  * "
  * &
  * <
  * >

In SQL (especially Oracle) we will use ', <> in order to delimit VARCHARS and to perform not equals operations (in Oracle != is synonymous with <>). Using the CDATA tag as seen in the SQL _anotherName_ tells any XML parser to take this text as being literal. 

= Why no XSD or DTD =
It's a very simple format and one which does not require any complicated XSD definitions. If the format is extended then this might trigger a need for a schema.
