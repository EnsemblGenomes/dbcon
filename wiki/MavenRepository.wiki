= Repository =

Currently DbCon is not hosted on ibiblio (and the chances of this happening are slim). Therefore a repository has been created in subversion. This is available from http://dbcon.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/maven-repo and should behave in the same way a normal Maven repository works in. This is also subject to the same conditions as any other repository. Any release made here will not be changed & new releases will be made as and when required.
